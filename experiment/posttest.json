      "question": "Explain how smart contracts can improve the efficiency of supply chain processes.",
      "answers": {
        "a": "By reducing paperwork and manual documentation.",
        "b": "By automatically executing and enforcing agreements.",
        "c": "By providing real-time visibility into the supply chain.",
        "d": "All of the above."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Smart contracts reduce paperwork and manual processes, enhancing efficiency.",
        "b": "Correct! Smart contracts automatically execute and enforce agreements without the need for intermediaries.",
        "c": "Correct! Smart contracts provide real-time visibility, improving transparency in the supply chain.",
        "d": "Correct! All of the above statements are true regarding how smart contracts can improve supply chain efficiency."

    {
      "question": "In what ways can smart contracts enhance transparency in supply chain management?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "By recording every transaction on an immutable blockchain.",
        "b": "By allowing only authorized participants to access information.",
        "c": "By encrypting all supply chain data.",
        "d": "By automating all supply chain processes."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Smart contracts enhance transparency by recording transactions on an immutable blockchain.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Transparency is achieved by making information accessible to all authorized participants.",
        "c": "Incorrect. While encryption may secure data, it doesn't necessarily enhance transparency.",
        "d": "Incorrect. While smart contracts automate processes, transparency is about open access to information, not automation."

    {
      "question": "What role do intermediaries play in a supply chain with smart contracts?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Intermediaries become unnecessary as smart contracts automate processes.",
        "b": "Intermediaries are still required to execute smart contracts.",
        "c": "Smart contracts have no impact on the role of intermediaries.",
        "d": "Intermediaries become more prominent in a blockchain-based supply chain."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Smart contracts aim to reduce the need for intermediaries by automating processes.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The goal of smart contracts is to eliminate the need for intermediaries.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Smart contracts do impact the role of intermediaries by automating and streamlining processes.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Smart contracts are designed to reduce the reliance on intermediaries in supply chain processes."
