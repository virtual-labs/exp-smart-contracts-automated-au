<u><h3>Theory</h3></u>
<b><p> Smart contract</p></b>

<p><b>Traditional contracts:</b> These are written agreements between two or more parties, outlining rights, obligations, and consequences. They rely on trust, legal systems, and intermediaries like lawyers for enforcement.</p>

<p><b>Smart contracts:</b> Smart contracts are computer programs that are hosted and executed on a blockchain network. Each smart contract consists of code specifying predetermined conditions that, when met, trigger outcomes. By running on a decentralised blockchain instead of a centralised server, smart contracts allow multiple parties to come to a shared result in an accurate, timely, and tamper-proof manner.

 <p>Smart contracts have the potential to revolutionise a wide range of industries, including supply chain management, financial services, and healthcare.

<p><b>IBM, Honeywell, and Walmart</b> are three of the world's leading companies that are using smart contracts in real-world applications.

<p> We have developed a usecase on Secure and Transparent Pharmaceutical Supply Chain with Blockchain</p>
<p>Problem: Medicine transport is complicated and can expose patients to fake drugs or spoiled medicine, costing money and harming people.</p>

- <p><b>Providing a tamper-proof record of every transaction:</b> This allows all parties involved in the supply chain to track and verify the authenticity of pharmaceuticals, from manufacturing to dispensing.</p>

- <p><b>Enhancing traceability:</b> With blockchain, it is possible to trace the origin of a pharmaceutical product and identify its location at all times. This enables authorities to quickly identify and isolate counterfeit drugs and respond to product recalls.</p>

- <p><b>Improving temperature control:</b> Blockchain can be used to monitor the temperature of pharmaceuticals in real-time, ensuring that they are stored and transported within safe limits.
</p>

- <p><b>Identifying potential shortages:</b> By analysing real-time inventory data, potential shortages can be predicted and addressed proactively. This allows manufacturers to adjust production schedules and distributors to optimise stock allocation.</p>

- <p><b>Preventing overstocking:</b> With accurate insights into demand and supply, overstocking situations can be avoided, reducing unnecessary costs and potential waste.</p>

- <p><b>Streamlined communication:</b> Blockchain-based platforms enable efficient communication between manufacturers, distributors, healthcare providers, and regulatory authorities, ensuring timely information exchange and coordinated actions.</p>

- <p><b>Faster decision-making:</b> With access to comprehensive and up-to-date data, stakeholders can make informed decisions faster, responding to surging demand with agility and adaptability.</p>
