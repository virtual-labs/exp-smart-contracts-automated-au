<u><h3>Procedure</h3></u>
 <p>In this simulation, we will demonstrate Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Simulation with Blockchain. </p>
 <p>To demonstrate the application of blockchain in enhancing transparency, traceability, and security in the pharmaceutical supply chain, mitigating the risks associated with the transportation of medicines.</p>
 <b><p>1. Shipment of goods </p></b>
 <p> Manufacturer initiates the simulation by adding a new set of goods for shipment.
 The blockchain network notifies all relevant entities, including distributors, retailers, pharmacists, and customers.</p>
 
 - <p>Choose medicine name , and quantity from the list and set an  expiry date, upon submiting the form ,a table containing the details of the medicine will be visible .</p> 
 - <p>Observe a new block being added to the ledger having all the details of the medicine </p>

 <b><p>2.Goods in Transit</p></b>
 <p> Distributor picks up the goods from the manufacturer.
 During transit, real-time information about the medicine, such as temperature, expiry date, and humidity, is recorded on the blockchain.</p>
 
 - <p>Copy paste the batch number for the medicine data table and click on view details will provide details about the medicine . </p>
  <div><img src="./images/distributors.png" alt="medicine going to warehouse "></div>
 <b><p>3.Goods Arrival at Warehouse </p></b>
 <p>Goods reach the warehouse. Warehouse personnel can access current details of the medicine through the blockchain, ensuring transparency and traceability.</p>

 - Copy paste the batch number for the medicine data table and click on view details will provide details about the medicine .
 
 - Observe the blocks being added to the ledger having the details of the medicine

 <b><p>4.Order Placement:Retailer Stage </p></b>
 <p> Retailer checks the current details of the medicine.Pharmacist places an order based on stock and demand.Blockchain records the order transaction.</p>
 
 - <p>Choose the medicine that needs to be restocked according to the demand and stock left . </p>
 
  <div><img src="./images/pharmacy.png" alt="pharmacy table "></div>

 - <p>Enter the required quantity of medicine needed, set expecting delivery date , click on the place order button.</p>

 <b><p>5. Goods Dispatch  from Warehouse</p></b>
 <p>Retailer dispatches the ordered goods to the pharmacy.
Pharmacist checks the details of the medicine through the blockchain before accepting the shipment.</p>

- Clicks on the next button to proceed to the next stage of the process.
- Observe the blocks being added to the ledger and the corresponding changes in the ledger as the pharmacist places an order and goods are dispatched, observe a reduction in the total medicine quantity in the warehouse, reflecting the sale to the pharmacy.

<b><p>6.Order Placement:Customer Stage</p></b>
<p>Customers receive notifications and place orders. Blockchain records the order transactions.</p>

- Click on any of the options given and enter the medicine name and its quantity.

- <p>The simulation concludes once the medicine successfully passes through each stage.</p>
- <p>Each transaction adds a block to the blockchain ledger, providing a tamper-proof record of the entire supply chain process.</p>
- <b><p>Enhanced Traceability:</b> Blockchain ensures a transparent and traceable record of the medicine's journey.</p>
- <p><b>Improved Temperature Control:</b> Real-time monitoring of temperature during transportation.</p>
- <p><b>Tamper-Proof Records:</b> Every transaction is securely recorded on the blockchain, preventing unauthorized alterations.</p>
