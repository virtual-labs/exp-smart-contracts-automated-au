      "question": "What is a smart contract in the context of blockchain?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.",
        "b": "A physical document signed by parties involved in a blockchain transaction.",
        "c": "A traditional legal contract stored on a blockchain.",
        "d": "A type of cryptocurrency used for executing transactions on a blockchain."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms written into code, automatically enforcing the agreement.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Smart contracts are digital and self-executing, eliminating the need for physical documents.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Smart contracts are not traditional legal contracts but programmable contracts on a blockchain.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Smart contracts are code-based, not a type of cryptocurrency."

      "question": "How can smart contracts benefit supply chain management?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "By increasing transparency and traceability in the supply chain.",
        "b": "By eliminating the need for any human intervention in supply chain processes.",
        "c": "By reducing the overall complexity of supply chain systems.",
        "d": "By providing a secure way to store physical goods in the supply chain."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Smart contracts enhance transparency and traceability by recording every transaction on the blockchain.",
        "b": "Incorrect. While smart contracts automate processes, some human intervention may still be required in supply chain management.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Smart contracts may add complexity due to their programmable nature but offer benefits in return.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Smart contracts deal with digital information on the blockchain, not physical goods."
